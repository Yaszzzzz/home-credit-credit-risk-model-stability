Overview
The project aims to develop a robust credit risk model using data provided by Home Credit. 
The dataset includes various financial and personal attributes of loan applicants, which are used to predict the likelihood of default. 
The model is evaluated based on its ability to predict loan defaults accurately.

Dataset
The dataset is provided in parquet format and consists of multiple files corresponding to different data sources related to loan applicants. 
These include static data, credit bureau records, previous loan applications, and more. Data preprocessing involves reading, cleaning, and aggregating these files into a single dataset suitable for modeling.

Feature Engineering
Feature engineering is a crucial step where additional features are created from the raw dataset to improve model performance. 
This includes handling missing values, transforming date variables, creating aggregation features, and encoding categorical variables.

Model Training
The training process involves fitting several machine learning models to the prepared dataset. The models used include:

CatBoostClassifier: A gradient boosting model that handles categorical variables naturally.
LGBMClassifier: Another gradient boosting model optimized for large datasets.
XGBClassifier: A powerful gradient boosting model known for its efficiency and performance.
Models are trained using cross-validation to ensure robustness and generalization. Hyperparameter tuning and early stopping techniques are applied to prevent overfitting.

Evaluation
Model performance is evaluated using the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC) metric. 
Cross-validation is used to estimate performance on unseen data partitions.

Submission
Predictions for the test dataset are generated using the trained models. These predictions are then formatted according to the Kaggle competition submission requirements and saved as CSV files.
