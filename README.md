Project Overview
The project aims to build a predictive model for assessing credit risk using data provided by Home Credit. The model predicts the probability of default for each loan application based on various financial and personal attributes of the applicants.

3. Dataset <a name="dataset"></a>
The dataset is provided in parquet format and includes multiple files from different sources related to loan applicants (e.g., static data, credit bureau records). Data preprocessing involves cleaning, aggregating, and transforming these files into a unified dataset suitable for modeling.

4. Feature Engineering <a name="feature-engineering"></a>
Feature engineering involves creating new features from the raw dataset to enhance model performance. Steps include handling missing values, date variable transformations, aggregation features creation, and categorical variable encoding.

5. Model Training <a name="model-training"></a>
The project trains several machine learning models including:

CatBoostClassifier
LGBMClassifier
XGBClassifier
Models are trained using cross-validation with hyperparameter tuning and early stopping techniques to prevent overfitting.

6. Evaluation <a name="evaluation"></a>
Model performance is evaluated using the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC) metric. Cross-validation provides estimates of model performance on unseen data partitions.

7. Submission <a name="submission"></a>
Predictions for the test dataset are generated using trained models and saved as CSV files in the submissions/ directory, formatted according to Kaggle competition submission requirements.

8. Environment Setup <a name="environment-setup"></a>
